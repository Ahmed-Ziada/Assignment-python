# String_programs
this project contains **4** programs as the below:

**1-** Repeated Substring and gives you the Substring and counting the Repeated substring  funaction name: f(S)

**2-** Simple string matching You will be given two strings a and b consisting of lower case letters, but a will have at most one asterix character. The asterix (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase letters. No other character of string a can be replaced. If it is possible to replace the asterix in a to obtain string b, then string b matches the pattern.
If the string matches, return true else false. funaction name: solve(a,b)

**3-** Is it a palindrome? checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome. funcaction name: is_palindrome(s)

**4-** Find the NO of occurrence of a word in a string! Function Name: find(substring,string,occurrence).
